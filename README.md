# TriviaGame

This web app was completed to better understand how Javascript interacts with DOM objects. Objects are placed and taken out with simple hardcoding.

Functionality:
A countdown is initiated with each question, and if no answer is given, a new question will appear. Correct and incorrect answers are stored, and different feedback is given for the appropriate answers (correct/incorrect). At the end of the list of questions, your score is displayed with the amount correct and incorrect.

Though used with global variables and hard coded DOM elements, this project was a key component to building my current understanding of how Javascript works.
